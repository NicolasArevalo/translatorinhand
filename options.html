    <h1>translator in hand</h1>
    <h3>Why does the extension need your API KEY?</h3>
    <p>I made this extension because I actually have the need of translate many words I see around. I built the
        extension for fun
        because I wanted to be able to use it for my own purposes. Now I want to publish it for free, so anyone can use
        it.
        Nontheless, the API have a limitation, as you can see if you follow the instructions, the free plan allows you
        to translate
        500.000 characters. So if I publish it for free, the characters will run out so fast. The other option was to
        pay the pro Plan,
        but I can't afford it right now for a free extension, and I don't want to charge the users (guessing I will
        have). So it's better
        if you get your own API KEY and use it. <br>
        Notice I'm not able to see your key, it is saved locally for your own use.
