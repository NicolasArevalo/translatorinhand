# Translator in Hand

This is a extension available in Chrome Web Store, and for the browsers based in Chromium.
The main idea was to create a tool that allows me to translate any word easily and fast.
That's why I decided to build this extension, and now it works for me, I thought _why not just publish it_, and here we are. On the way to publish the extension.

I built it in around 7 hours. This is not the code I'm proudest of, but I just tried to follow the Chrome instructions and make it work.

I hope you can enjoy it soon :)

There is some instructions you need to follow to use the extension. I wrote a full description step by step to configure the extension. You just need to install it, open it (click on the logo extension or Alt+T) and go to settings, there is a button "see full instructions" and there you can go step by step.

Made my (meeee)['https://niiico.com'] :)
